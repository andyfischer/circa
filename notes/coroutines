how to do coroutines?

function is going along..

Branch 1:
a();
b();
c():
    Branch 2:
    x()
    y()  <-- decides to wait
    z()
d();
e();

Stop branches, all the way up until a run_coroutine() call.
Preserve relevant pieces of stack, and save execution position.

EvalContext has a 'interrupt' tagged_value.
Functions can specify that they can catch an interrupt.

subroutine_t::catch_interrupt:
  If interrupt->type is 'return':
      Reset interrupt, stop branch
  If interrupt->type is 'coroutine_pause':
      Preserve the stack and the instruction pointer somewhere
      Preserve it on the CoroutinePause value, I guess
      Propogate this interrupt upwards

run_coroutine::catch_interrupt:
  Catch everything
  If interrupt type is CoroutinePause, then save this to state

Changing the definition of a function when there are existing CoroutinePause values?
